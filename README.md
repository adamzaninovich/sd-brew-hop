# SD Brew Hop

A web application to track the breweries you've been to in San Diego.
Can you **hop** them all?

### Why?

As of 11/12/13, there are 80 breweries in San Diego County. We wanted to
create a way for people to keep track of the ones they have been to and
get suggestions for new ones to visit. Also, with over 30 more breweries
currently in the process of opening, we wanted to provide a place to
keep track of all the breweries in the county.
